# Software_specs_code 

This is the code repository for our specs project.

If you don't feel comfortable pushing your changes on to the repo ask me and Ill show/do it for you. Don't worry
too much about messing it up. I have a local copy on mutiple machines. (yay for redundancy!)

To the build the program in IDE (mainly eclipse similar logic should work for other IDEs):

NOTE: I am including an executable in this repo so you guys can use it. Just make sure the Database file is in the same working directory as the executable. Also, make sure github desktop client and eGit for eclipse are installed to use the code.
	  
1.) clone this repository somewhere on your computer.
2.) Next, open eclipse (doesn't matter what workspace you choose).
3.) Now, choose File -> import -> git projects from git and click next.
4.) Choose exiting local repository and click next. Select this repository and click next.
5.) Choose, import as general project and then select Spec_Project. Click finish.
6.) Name the project and click finish.
7.) Before you can start coding you need to convert this project into a maven project(should know how this is done lol). Leave the pom file in there it will handle any dependencies. Now you can start coding :)

I believe that is it. Contact me if any of you have problems.

P.S you can ignore the SQL_stuff folder. I have it here so I don't lose the database completely. 
Was a pain in the ass to create. Also will "HELP" make alteration and changes more managable (at least I hope so lol).
