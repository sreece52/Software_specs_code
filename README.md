# Software_specs_code 

This is the code repository for our specs project.

If you don't feel comfortable pushing your changes on to the repo ask me and Ill show/do it for you. Don't worry
too much about messing it up. I have a local copy on mutiple machines. (yay for redundancy!)

To the build the program in IDE (mainly eclipse similar logic should work for other IDEs):

NOTE: I am including an executable in this repo so you guys can it. 
	  Just make sure the Database file is in the same working directory as the executable.

1.) clone this repository somewhere on your computer.
2.) In eclipse (Whatever IDE you are using) import the src code found in src
		note: all the source code is broken up into packages. Keep it that way, please. Helps organize projects.
3.) Convert the project into a maven project if you have not already. 
4.) Import/copy_over the pom.xml found in the dependencies folder. (delete / replace the one maven creates)
5.) Import the Handyman Scheduler logo found in resources.
6.) Import the newDB.mv.db file in eclipse. This is needed for the program and H2 or what ever enigne you use can find it. 

I believe that is it. Contact me if any of you have problems.

P.S you can ignore the SQL_stuff folder. I have it here so I don't lose the database completely. 
Was a pain in the ass to create. Also will "HELP" make alteration and changes more managable (at least I hope so lol).
